# Spam-Detection-API
This repository contains a Spam Detection API built using Django REST Framework (DRF). The API allows users to manage contacts, detect spam phone numbers, and mark them as spam while providing JWT-based authentication for secure access. It is designed as a robust backend service for applications requiring spam detection features.
